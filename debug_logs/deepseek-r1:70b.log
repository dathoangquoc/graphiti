Do **not** hallucinate or infer temporal bounds from unrelated events.\n\n# DATETIME RULES\n\n- Use ISO 8601 with “Z” suffix (UTC) (e.g., 2025-04-30T00:00:00Z).\n- If the fact is ongoing (present tense), set `valid_at` to REFERENCE_TIME.\n- If a change/termination is expressed, set `invalid_at` to the relevant timestamp.\n- Leave both fields `null` if no explicit or resolvable time is stated.\n- If only a date is mentioned (no time), assume 00:00:00.\n- If only a year is mentioned, use January 1st at 00:00:00.\n        \n\nRespond with a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{"$defs": {"Edge": {"properties": {"relation_type": {"description": "FACT_PREDICATE_IN_SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE", "title": "Relation Type", "type": "string"}, "source_entity_name": {"description": "The name of the source entity of the fact.", "title": "Source Entity Name", "type": "string"}, "target_entity_name": {"description": "The name of the target entity of the fact.", "title": "Target Entity Name", "type": "string"}, "fact": {"description": "", "title": "Fact", "type": "string"}, "valid_at": {"anyOf": [{"type": "string"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null, "description": "The date and time when the relationship described by the edge fact became true or was established.
